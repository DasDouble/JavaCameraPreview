Java Camera In-App-Preview

This is finally an up to date (Android 13.0) code, to implement the camera in your app.
It will automatically ask you for permission to use the camera when first time opening it.

Use code 
'CameraPreviewActivity' as your Java code 
and 
'activity_camera_preview' as your .xml file in res -> layout -> new file -> Layout Resource File -> name it activity_camera_preview
done, now you can use it.

Where will the pictures be safed?
-> I don't know anymore, ask ChatGPT, you can change the path yourself. Look it up in 'CameraPreviewActivity'.
